==Overview==

Helper C library for writing UDFs for Firebird in Lua (as well as a small [http://code.google.com/p/firebird-lua-udfs/source/browse/src/lua_udf.sql collection of useful UDFs]). The Firebird UDF interface would hopefully be obsoleted in Firebird v3.0 and replaced with the new External Engine API. Until then, I hope you find this little library helpful. Any feedback is welcome and appreciated.

==Status==

The helper library and the sample UDFs are tested and work on Win32 and Linux32 platforms.
For installation instructions, read [http://code.google.com/p/firebird-lua-udfs/source/browse/INSTALL.TXT INSTALL.TXT].

For tips on how to write UDFs for Firebird yourself, read UdfWritingTips.

PS: If writing UDFs in Lua seems overkill, checkout my [http://code.google.com/p/firebird-fpc-udfs/ other UDF library] written in freepascal.
