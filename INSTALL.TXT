Pre-build binaries, building scripts, as well as source and binary
dependencies are included in the package for the following platforms:
 - Win32 (build is via MSVC++ 8.0)
 - Linux32

Build scripts can be made for any platform supported by the Firebird
client library and Lua.

Installation for Win32 platforms
--------------------------------
1. Copy build.win32\lua_udf.dll to your Firebird's UDF directory.
2. Copy ib_util.dll to your Firebird's bin directory.
3. Copy src\lua_udf.lua somewhere: you'll load it with full path
via the UDF load_lua_lib(filepath), which will initialize the library.
4. Register the UDFs to your database by attaching to the database
and running src\lua_udf.sql.

Installation for Linux32 platforms
----------------------------------
1. Copy build.linux32/lua_udf.so to your Firebird's UDF directory.
2. Copy src\lua_udf.lua somewhere: you'll load it with full path
via the UDF load_lua_lib(filepath), which will initialize the library.
3. Register the UDFs to your database by attaching to the database
and running src\lua_udf.sql.
